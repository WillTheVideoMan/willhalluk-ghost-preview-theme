# `willhall.uk` Ghost Preview Theme

A quick theme to give styling to the preview functions of Ghost, keeping things consistent with the final Gatsby site.

Just one of the little workarounds with Ghost CMS in a JAMStack environment.

This theme would not be very useful as a standalone Ghost theme, but works well to give a sense of consistency when using the preview buttons within the Ghost editor. Good for sanity and style checks.

The styling of this theme is directly copied from the Gatsby site, but might have some discrepancies if things are rendered slightly differently. More of a litmus test than a solid confirmation. It has none of the functionality of the main site. It just simply shows posts and pages as they would appear on the main site.
